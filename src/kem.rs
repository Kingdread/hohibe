//! High-level wrapper around HIBE operations.
//!
//! Usually, people don't communicate by sending each other group elements. Therefore, we provide
//! this opinionated and easier-to-use wrapper over the raw HIBE operations.
//!
//! The main struct is [`HybridKem`], which wraps a [`Hibe`] to provide high-level operations. The
//! main differences include:
//!
//! * Generated keys (from [`HibeKem`]) are hashed to `[u8; 16]` (128 Bit) using SHA3 to make it
//!   easy to use them in other cryptographic primitives.
//! * Encryption and decryption (from [`HibeCrypt`][super::hibe::HibeCrypt]) is realized by using
//!   hybrid encryption, using the KEM and AES encryption on top. This allows you to easily encrypt
//!   byte sequences instead of group elements.
//! * Identities are mapped through a [`Mapper`], which makes it easier to specify identities at
//!   the call-site. You can for example provide a mapper that takes IP addresses as input, and
//!   outputs the correct "raw" identity.
//! * The types are wrapped in proper opaque structs instead of being type aliases. This makes it
//!   easier to implement new methods on those types or customize their behaviour (for example, by
//!   providing an easier-to-use [`Debug`] implementation).
//! * The methods in this module are restricted to [`CryptoRng`] random generators to enforce the
//!   use of cryptographically secure algorithms.
//!
//! To provide easier usability, this implementation is hardwired to use [`BonehBoyenGoh`] as the
//! underlying HIBE. This allows us to not fiddle around with too many generic parameters and
//! generic bounds. Maybe this will change in the future.
//!
//! As a default mapper, [`HashMapper`] is provided, which uses the existing [`std::hash::Hash`]
//! implementation on types to hash to a identity. Note that this may lead to collisions, like with
//! any hash â€” but they are expected to by unlikely, as the underlying hash is SHA3-256.
