# hohibe — Hierarchical Identity Based Encryption

This crate provides an implementation of hierarchical identity based encryption
for Rust. For more information, please see the crate documentation (run `cargo
doc` to generate it).


## ⚠️ Warning: Cryptographic Hazmat ☣️

This crate is made for playing around with HIBE and for prototyping of applications and
protocols using HIBE. It has *not* been audited, it is *not* battle tested, and *nobody* claims
it to be secure.

Use it at **your own risk** and if you know what you are doing!
